    <string name="wifi_faq_select_wifi">Wi-Fi scales FAQ</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_select_bluetooth">Bluetooth scales FAQ</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q1">1.What if the body fat scales is not accurate?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a1">The accuracy of body fat scales has something to do with where you put it. First, make sure it is placed on a solid and flat ground. Extra note: it is best measured when you are cleared, for example, weigh yourself when you get up in the morning or wear few clothes. Pay attention to the weighing method: take off shoes and socks before measurement, do not leave or shake until the display of the data. The next weighing should be done after the screen is off for 2–3 seconds.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q2">2.When is it more accurate to weigh?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a2">Be sure to measure with bare feet and make sure the soles of feet are dry. It is recommended to measure at a fixed time every day to reduce errors caused by external factors such as exercise, diet and hot bath. The optimal frequency is twice a day. Measure in the morning after defecating and before bathing, and before bathing in the evening. Meanwhile, because of human body\'s metabolism, the physical data measured in the morning and evening will have some fluctuations. It is recommended not to simply compare the data measured at different times.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q3">3.Why do the weighing data vary from different ground surfaces?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a3">The sensor of the body fat scales is highly sensitive. When measuring, it should be placed on a solid and flat ground. If the ground is uneven or placed on soft grounds such as blankets and foam, the data may be inaccurate.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q4">4.Why is there no content displayed on the screen of body fat scales during measurement?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a4">The usual reasons are: if the battery runs out, please replace the battery in time; if the battery is installed backwards, the trouble can be solved by installing the battery correctly according to the tips of body fat scales.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q5">5.Why does the App only show weight data and not body fat rate and other data?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a5">Reason 1: the current user is less than 10 years old. Due to the rapid growth and development of children, it is impossible to measure and calculate accurate body fat rate data. If you accidentally set the age by mistake, you can modify it in \"Me\" – \"Personal information\"\nReason 2: feet are not in good contact with the electrodes on the surface of the body fat scales. Try cleaning the scales surface with a wet towel and stepping on the scales with bare feet for measurement.\nReason 3: you leave the body fat scales before it accomplishes measuring. The screen displays weight and flashes three times, then \"----\" from left to right to indicate that the measurement of body fat is completed. At this point, body fat and other relevant information can be seen in the App.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q6">6.Will my weighing information be recorded when the App is not opened?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a6">As long as the body fat scales is currently bound to your HealthU+ account and successfully networked (i.e. the Wi-Fi indicator light is on after weighing), the weighing result will be recorded in the App in real time and can be viewed at any time.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q7">7.Why is my weighing result not seen in the App?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a7">Step 1: please confirm whether the Wi-Fi indicator light on the body fat scales is on during the weighing process (if not, it means that the scales has not successfully networked, please reconnect);\nStep 2: enter \"Me\" - \"Device binding\" to check whether the body fat scales is successfully bound to the currently logged in HealthU+ account;\nStep 3: refresh the home page of the body fat scales to see whether it is judged as an \"unknown weight data\" entry. If this happens, click \"claim\" to claim this entry to the corresponding sub-account, and then you can make an accurate match next time.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q8">8.What if the weighing message notification is not received?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a8">Different users can directly bind the body fat scales for use with their respective HealthU+ accounts. You can also create multiple family member accounts under the same HealthU+ account to use together.</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_q9">9.What if my weighing record is recorded in the other family members\' mobile APPs?</string>
    <string name="wifi_faq_a9">If no other user binds the body fat scales, all weighing records of the scales will be recorded to the only bound user in operation, which can be deleted in history data management. \nIf you don\'t want your family\'s records to be mistakenly synced into your account, one way to do this is to create a subaccount for your family and fill out their body composition details, the second way is to ask family members to use their own HealthU+ account to bind the scales, and timely process the physical data to be claimed, so as to help us judge the data attribution more accurately. If there are multiple errors recorded. Please contact the developer in \"My\" in the app.</string>
